### Explanation:
- The table is titled "Employee Information" to provide context.
- Headers are aligned appropriately: text columns are left-aligned, and numeric columns (Salary) are right-aligned for better readability.
- Each column is separated by a pipe (`|`), and headers are separated from the data rows by a line of dashes (`-`), with colons (`:`) indicating alignment.
